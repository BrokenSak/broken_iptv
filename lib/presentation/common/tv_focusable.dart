/// Wraps a child so it works with pointer (mouse/touch) *and* D-pad input.
///
/// Focus rules (each learned the hard way):
/// - **Focusable on any Android build** ([dpadFocusEnabled]), never on
///   Windows. Gating focusability on the saved TV mode locked fresh installs
///   out — the device picker shows *before* a mode exists, so nothing was
///   focusable and the remote couldn't even choose "TV".
/// - **Autofocus only where a D-pad is expected** ([dpadAutofocusEnabled]):
///   TV mode or no mode chosen yet. Honouring it on phones lit up the first
///   tile of every grid on its own.
/// - **The focus RING shows only in D-pad mode** ([dpadHighlightVisible]).
///   Android nodes stay focusable everywhere (so the remote always works), but
///   on a phone a focused node must look no different — the feedback there is a
///   momentary press highlight, and on Windows the mouse hover. Otherwise a
///   stray focus leaves a ring that touch can't clear ("la prima voce resta
///   evidenziata").
///
/// The widget is a single focus node (a previous version nested two, so the
/// D-pad focus landed on the node without the key handler and OK did
/// nothing): OK activates on key-up, and holding OK (key repeat) triggers
/// [onLongPress] — the D-pad equivalent of a touch long-press.
